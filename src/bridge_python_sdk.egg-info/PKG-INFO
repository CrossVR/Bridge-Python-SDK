# Looking Glass Bridge SDK · Python Edition

Integrate your existing Python-based 3D workflow with any Looking Glass display and treat the holographic panel as a second, light-field monitor. This package wraps the native Bridge SDK so you can render quilts in OpenGL, hand them off to Bridge, and see them instantly on the device – all without leaving Python.

## Features

* **Simple setup –** use the included Looking Glass Bridge driver or download the latest version from the Looking Glass Bridge website. 
* **Cross-platform wheels –** pre-built for Windows (x86-64), macOS (universal2), and manylinux (x86-64/arm64); each wheel already bundles the correct Bridge driver so you can `pip install` and go. 
* **Reference camera & quilt math** – helper classes to distort projection matrices and assemble quilts.  
* **Examples included** – `RotatingCube.py` and `SolarSystem.py` show minimal and advanced pipelines.  
* **Zero-copy texture path** – pass existing OpenGL textures; no CPU read-backs required.  

## Installation

```bash
pip install looking-glass-bridge-sdk
```

On Linux you must run under **X11**; Wayland is not yet supported.

## Quick Start

See `src/bridge_python_sdk/Examples` for fully-worked programmes that spin a cube and orbit a solar system.

## Prerequisites

Your application (or the provided examples) must be able to:

1. **Render multiple views** of the scene per frame.  
2. **Distort the projection matrix** supplied by the SDK.  
3. **Render into an OpenGL texture** that the SDK can access.  

## Documentation

* **Camera model** – learn how eye positions are generated for each view.  
* **Quilts** – understand the tiled texture fed to Bridge.  
* **How Looking Glass works** – deep dive into light-field rendering.

All docs live at <https://docs.lookingglassfactory.com>.
